## Latest News

- 2023/03/23: OpenTextClassification V0.0.1 is officially open source, version features:
	- Support bilingual text classification in Chinese and English
	- Support multiple text classification models: traditional machine learning shallow model, deep learning model and transformers class model
	- Support multi-label text classification
	- Support multiple embedding methods: inner/outer/random


## Development Plan

The OpenTextClassification project is the first official open source project of the OpenNLP program, aiming at Open NLP for everyone! In the era of LLMs represented by ChatGPT/GPT4, before being swept to death by OpenAI, do something meaningful! One day in the future, when GPT-X is released, some people may say that NLP does not exist, but we want to prove that someone has been here!



## Steps for usage

1. Clone this project

`git clone https://github.com/catqaq/OpenTextClassification.git`

2. Dataset download and preprocessing

I will add another automation script when I have time, please handle it by yourself or refer to preprocessing.py for the time being.

It is best to put the data in the data directory, such as data/dbpedia, and then divide it into 3 subdirectories. Input stores the original data set (the data set you downloaded), and data stores the preprocessed formatted data set (text-label format), saved_dict stores the training results (model and log, etc.).

3. Run the example

The tested development environment is as follows, for reference only, almost all environments should be able to run.

- python: 3.6/3.7
- torch: 1.6.0
- transformers: 4.18.0
- torchtext: 0.7.0
- scikit-learn: 0.24.2
-tensorboardX:2.6
-nltk:3.6.7
- numpy: 1.18.5
- pandas: 1.1.5



Select the module to run according to your own needs, see the next section for details.

`python run.py`

## Run the example

1. Run the DNN/transformers class model for text classification

`python run.py`

2. Run the traditional shallow machine learning model for text classification

`python run_shallow.py`

3. Run the DNN/transformers class model to do multi-label text classification

`python run_multi_label.py`



The following table is the reference result of running the demo directly:

Operating environment: python3.6 + T4

## Result display: to be continued

The author provides detailed experimental results from shallow to deep to multi-label for your reference. However, due to limited time and computing power, many experiments may not be optimal, please know! Therefore, everyone is very welcome to actively contribute, supplement related experiments, codes, new models, etc., and build OpenTextClassification together.

For the time being, only part of the summary results are provided. I will add detailed experimental results and parameters when I have time. There are many, and it will take some time to sort them out.

## Sponsor us

who are we?

We are Xianyu Intelligent [xianyu.ai], the main members are a group of salted fish from the foot of Laohe Mountain and the edge of the West Lake(namely, Zhejiang University). The owner of the pond is called Xianyu. We want to do something meaningful in LLMs! Our slogan is: Do OpenNLP and OpenX! Hope to quit the rivers and lakes before OpenAI rolls us to death!

The OpenTextClassification project is the first official open source project of the OpenNLP project initiated by Xianyu Intelligent [xianyu.ai], aiming at Open NLP for everyone! In the era of LLMs represented by ChatGPT/GPT4, before being swept to death by OpenAI, do something meaningful! One day in the future, when GPT-X is released, some people may say that NLP does not exist, but we want to prove that someone has been here!

The first version of this project was independently completed by Ben Xianyu during his business hours (staying up late). Limited by energy and computing power, it has been delayed until now. Fortunately, it has been successfully completed. If you think this project is helpful to your NLP study/research/work, please ask for a free star! Rich brothers and sisters can consider sponsoring it! Especially the computing power, the cost of renting a card has already made me quite painful.
